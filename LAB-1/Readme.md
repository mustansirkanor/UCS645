## 📖 Overview

This lab is a deep dive into **parallel programming using OpenMP**. As a developer primarily experienced in **C++**, I challenged myself to implement these programs in **C** to better understand:

- ⚡ Manual memory management with `malloc()` and `free()`
- 🧠 Memory layout and cache optimization
- 🔍 Low-level control over data structures
- 📊 Performance profiling at the hardware level

All programs use **dynamic memory allocation** to explore how memory access patterns impact parallel performance.
